getting weird lengths of array, should only be pwoers of 2 but getting 271 					fixed

faster to do the fft on 32 bit floating points or to convert 32 bit to 16 bit int and do fft on that

add channel exception for when the channel amount is more than 2			oops never did it

the from wav file functionality is pretty much useless, introduces issues with timing and doesn't actually give any benefits - remove the functionality?			removed

forms inheriting unclosableform cant be designed, but unclosableform can wtf - 				fixed by changing to not mustinherit

record the output from speakers - need to find samplerate, channels and bit depth as well as learn how to actaully use naudio			fixed
buffer wasapiloopbackcapture to something, then find the format of the sound, and then pass that to the fft to do the fft on it			fixed


make chart fill out new form - 				fixed

create graph settings forms, and can have new values called - 					fixed
needs to 'grey out' settings that aren't appllicable to certain graph types				oops never did that
settings forms: - choose colour of graph				fixed
		- width of individual lines				fixed
		- max height						fixed	
		- seperation of lines					bad idea not implemented
		- sensitivity of graph					fixed
		- spectrum invert					fixed
		- scale toggle						fixed
		- change type of graph					fixed

not sure if line speration is real or not, may need to remove from ojectives			removed lmao

radar chart type causes crash									just removed that graph type ez fix

make graph on base form be a preview of what graph would look like - done				fixed

naudio record and buffer sound									fixed

fix fft? kind of works but also doesnt, see FromFileAndLiveProtoWithCooley-Tukey, click on graph						fixed

transfer everything created in runtime to created in initialisation for GraphForm, LEDSettingsForm, GraphSettingsForm - done					fixed

create an abstract class for GraphForm, LEDSettingsForm, GraphSettingsForm containing closing function to stop it from being destroyed - done		fixed but then changed back as this caused issues when designing
